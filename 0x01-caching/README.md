# Caching

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- **What a Caching System Is**: Understand the purpose of caching systems and how they store copies of frequently accessed data to improve performance and reduce access time.

- **What FIFO Means**: Explain the First In, First Out caching strategy, where the oldest data is evicted first when the cache is full.

- **What LIFO Means**: Understand the Last In, First Out caching strategy, where the most recently added data is the first to be removed when space is needed.

- **What LRU Means**: Describe the Least Recently Used caching strategy, where the data that has not been accessed for the longest time is evicted first.

- **What MRU Means**: Explain the Most Recently Used caching strategy, where the most recently accessed data is removed first when the cache reaches its limit.

- **What LFU Means**: Understand the Least Frequently Used caching strategy, where the data accessed the least often is evicted first to make room for new data.

- **What the Purpose of a Caching System Is**: Discuss the benefits of caching, such as improving performance, reducing latency, and optimizing resource usage.

- **What Limits a Caching System Have**: Identify and explain the limitations of caching systems, including cache size, data staleness, overhead, and the complexity of cache management.

## Overview
This project covers the essential concepts of caching systems, including different caching strategies and their applications. By the end of this project, you should be able to articulate the purpose, functionality, and limitations of various caching mechanisms in a distributed system or single-machine environment.
